# docker-autoheal

https://hub.docker.com/r/willfarrell/autoheal

Monitor and restart unhealthy docker containers. This functionality was proposed to be included with the addition of HEALTHCHECK, however didn't make the cut. This container is a stand-in till there is native support for --exit-on-unhealthy https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/22719.


### Supported tags and Dockerfile links
  - `latest` (Dockerfile)

### How to use

```bash
docker run -d \
    --name autoheal \
    --restart=always \
    -e AUTOHEAL_CONTAINER_LABEL=all \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    willfarrell/autoheal
```

a) Apply the label autoheal=true to your container to have it watched.

b) Set ENV AUTOHEAL_CONTAINER_LABEL=all to watch all running containers.

c) Set ENV AUTOHEAL_CONTAINER_LABEL to existing label name that has the value true.

Note: You must apply HEALTHCHECK to your docker images first. See https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#healthcheck for details.

### ENV Defaults

```bash
AUTOHEAL_CONTAINER_LABEL=autoheal
AUTOHEAL_INTERVAL=5   # check every 5 seconds
AUTOHEAL_START_PERIOD=0   # wait 0 seconds before first health check
AUTOHEAL_DEFAULT_STOP_TIMEOUT=10   # Docker waits max 10 seconds (the Docker default) for a container to stop before killing during restarts (container overridable via label, see below)
DOCKER_SOCK=/var/run/docker.sock   # Unix socket for curl requests to Docker API
CURL_TIMEOUT=30     # --max-time seconds for curl requests to Docker API
```

#### Optional Container Labels

```bash
autoheal.stop.timeout=20        # Per containers override for stop timeout seconds during restart
```

### Testing

```bash
docker build -t autoheal .

docker run -d \
    -e AUTOHEAL_CONTAINER_LABEL=all \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    autoheal
```
